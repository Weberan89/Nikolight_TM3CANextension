# Nikolight CAN extension

## General introduction

This project serves as an extension to the Nikolight project, specifically designed as a CAN (Controller Area Network) Interpreter tailored for TM3 vehicles. The primary goal of this extension is to enhance the capabilities of the Nikolight project by providing a specialized interface for interpreting and decoding data transmitted over the CAN bus in TM3 cars.

The CAN Interpreter for TM3 facilitates seamless communication with the vehicle's internal network, allowing for the extraction and analysis of data, which might be of interest to actuate the ambient light. By interfacing directly with the Controller Area Network, the extension enables the Nikolight project to react based on vehicle status signals like turn indicators, target temperature changes or even ADAS functionalities like blind spot warning or front collision warning. Main intention is to provide additional visualization of informative signals.

## Features
